# gt-homework02 - Responsive Portfolio Assignment

## Preview

## Description

* This is a webpage meant to put my developer projects on display in a colorful way. In general, collaborative projects take some precedence at the top with the larger grid options. Individual or otherwise small projects follow. 

## Areas for Improvement

* I intend to reformat the page to incorporate more information per project on the webpage itself, rather than simply relying on folks to click on the images to be redirected straight to GitHub. This may include adding some JavaScript to have some nice functionality!TBD there.

* New colors in update2 for the text have also reinforced my desire to revisit the color scheme, though I still enjoy it for myself.
